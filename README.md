## FAQ

### Why write another randomiser?

* To separate out QoL and accessibility features into different mods, allowing you to play with them without it being rando
* For a better developer workflow
* To make it compatible with other mods

### Sein text is back!

You need the speed mod. For now, grab it from the randomiser's [releases page](https://github.com/Kirefel/OriDeRandomiser/releases/latest).
